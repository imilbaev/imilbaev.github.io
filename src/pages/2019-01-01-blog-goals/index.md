I welcome you on my personal blog. This blog was born in the process of exploring GatsbyJS framework. Gatsby turned out to be very simple, so gradually this experiment evolved into something bigger than simple pet project.

## The main objectives of the blog

### 1. Writing articles.

According to research [research](https://www.medicaldaily.com/why-using-pen-and-paper-not-laptops-boosts-memory-writing-notes-helps-recall-concepts-ability-268770 "Link to research description") the more you write about something, the more of that information remain in your head. Furthermore, writing an article requires an extensive research on the subject. Thus, it's a way to learn something new and save well structured information in brain.

### 2. Learn how to express my thoughts in English.

To date, I well understand English: whatch TV series and movies, read books and articles in English. However, sometimes I can't string two sentences together. Thus, this blog is an attempt to get out of my comfort zone.
